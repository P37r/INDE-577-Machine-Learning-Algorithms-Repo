# Linear Regression

---

## Overview

**Linear Regression** is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.

### Model Equation

$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_n x_n
$$

The model aims to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
$$
