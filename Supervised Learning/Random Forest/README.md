# Random Forest Classifier for Diabetes Prediction

---

## Overview

A **Random Forest** classifier is a supervised machine learning method used to classify data. It works by constructing an ensemble of individual Decision Tree models, each trained on a different subset of the data. Once trained, each tree makes its own prediction, and the **final output** of the Random Forest is the **majority vote** of those individual predictions (for classification tasks).

### Why It Works

To encourage diversity among the Decision Trees and prevent overfitting, Random Forests use a technique called **bootstrap aggregation** (also known as **bagging**). Here's how it works:
- Each tree is trained on a **random subset** of the dataset, sampled **with replacement**.
- For each split within a tree, a **random subset of features** is considered, not all features.

This randomness helps ensure the trees are different from one another. Then, by combining the predictions from all the trees, we get a model that:
- Generalizes well on unseen data
- Reduces variance compared to individual trees
- Maintains interpretability by still being based on decision rules

Random Forests can also be used for **regression**. In that case, instead of taking the majority vote, the model returns the **average** of predictions from all trees.

## Objective

**Task:** Predict whether or not a person has diabetes using labeled health data. This is a binary classification problem (1 = has diabetes, 0 = no diabetes).

---

## Dataset Features

The dataset includes a variety of personal health indicators:

- Gender  
- Age  
- Race  
- Hypertension  
- Heart Disease  
- Smoking  
- BMI  
- HbA1c Level  
- Blood Glucose Level
