# Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains standalone implementations of the following machine learning algorithms:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
- **Voting Ensemble**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Perceptron**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Neural Network**
- **DBSCAN**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

Each algorithm is implemented from scratch or using standard Python libraries and is organized for easy understanding and modification.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the results:

1. Download the required datasets from the `Data` folder in this repository.
2. In the corresponding script file for each algorithm, update the file path variable to point to the dataset you downloaded.
